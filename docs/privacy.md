#  Privacy Policy

We collect as little data as possible, and don't send it anywhere. The only data we collect is the amount of time you spend using the app for mindfulness sessions, and that is only stored in [the Health app](https://www.apple.com/ios/health/) if you choose to give our app access to it. We don't read any Health data, and you can revoke our app's access to writing Health data at any point through the Health app - it'll continue to work, it just won't automatically get logged to the Health app.
