# Meditime

Meditime is the simplest meditation timer available. Swipe up or down to set the timer -- set it to zero, and it'll run as a stopwatch -- and double-tap to start. When you're done, Meditime will automatically log the session to [the Health app](https://www.apple.com/ios/health/). And that's it; no muss or fuss, just doing what you want it to. And it was built [with privacy in mind](./privacy.html).
